## About this repository

This repository is a Plant UML diagrams collection of SLAM programs.  
All of diagrams is designed as C++ code. The purpose of this repository  
is to study the design and algorithm of SLAM.  

## Reference

All of diagrams is drawn based on [SLAM入門](https://www.amazon.co.jp/SLAM%E5%85%A5%E9%96%80-%E3%83%AD%E3%83%9C%E3%83%83%E3%83%88%E3%81%AE%E8%87%AA%E5%B7%B1%E4%BD%8D%E7%BD%AE%E6%8E%A8%E5%AE%9A%E3%81%A8%E5%9C%B0%E5%9B%B3%E6%A7%8B%E7%AF%89%E3%81%AE%E6%8A%80%E8%A1%93-%E5%8F%8B%E7%B4%8D-%E6%AD%A3%E8%A3%95/dp/4274221660/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_ja_JP=%E3%82%AB%E3%82%BF%E3%82%AB%E3%83%8A&crid=18ZYA7OX3FQIR&dchild=1&keywords=slam%E5%85%A5%E9%96%80&qid=1588648035&sprefix=slam%2Caps%2C1355&sr=8-1).  
This book introduces a technology of localization and mapping by SLAM.  
Some C++ sample programs are written in this book.  
I refer to those programs and drew a UML diagram of them.
